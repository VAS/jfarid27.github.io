*"Its in words that the magic is -- Abracadabra. Open Sesame, and the rest -- but the magic words in one story aren't magical in the next. The real magic is to understand which words work, and when, and for what: the trick is to learn the trick..." - John Barth, Chimera*

My daily routine involves front-end development with AngularJS, data visualization with D3,
dabbling with data wrangling, and after failing 
the question of "What is the running time of quicksort?" on my first programming interview, the 
intracacies of computer programming, logic, languages, and computer science itself.

A brief overview of my skills are below:

1. I know how to design declarative code using imperative knowledge, freeing future users of the details of how programs will
progress through a computation.

2. I have knowledge of asynchronous code patterns that allow programs to be non-blocking, a skill useful in a world with network
lag.

3. I strive to develop code in a functional manner in accordance with type theoretic abstraction principles. This generally makes
code parsimonious and easier to understand for future development.

4. I seek pros and cons before committing to developing methods to solve problems. A naive solution that can be explained by pen
and paper is likely the best solution in many cases.
