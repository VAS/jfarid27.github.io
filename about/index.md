*"Its in words that the magic is -- Abracadabra. Open Sesame, and the rest -- but the magic words in one story aren't magical in the next. The real magic is to understand which words work, and when, and for what: the trick is to learn the trick..." - John Barth, Chimera*

My daily routine involves front-end development with AngularJS, data visualization with D3,
dabbling with data wrangling, and after failing 
the question of "What is the running time of quicksort?" on my first programming interview, the 
intracacies of computer programming, logic, languages, and computer science itself.
