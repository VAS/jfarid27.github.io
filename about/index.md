>### _"Its in words that the magic is -- Abracadabra. Open Sesame, and the rest -- but the magic words in one story aren't magical in the next. The real magic is to understand which words work, and when, and for what: the trick is to learn the trick..." - John Barth, Chimera_

My daily routine involves front-end development with AngularJS, data visualization with (D3)[d3js.org], dabbling with data wrangling myself in a PANDAS/NUMPY/SCIPY stack, a ton of soccer, and, after failing the question of _"What is the running time of quicksort?"_ on my first programming interview, the intracacies of computer programming, languages, and computer science itself.

While we can never be assured of omniscience of our programs, I do believe programmers should strive to
balance **code quality**, **utility**, and **timing**.

- Developing quality specifications.
- Writing modular and testable software.
- Meeting deadlines.

### *The trick is to learn the trick.*
